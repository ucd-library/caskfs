## Running Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# Using npm scripts
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:core          # Core tests only
npm run test:integration   # Integration tests only
npm run test:watch         # Watch mode

# Using test runner script
./test/run-tests.sh all      # Run all tests
./test/run-tests.sh core     # Core tests only
./test/run-tests.sh init     # Initialize database
./test/run-tests.sh clean    # Run powerwash
./test/run-tests.sh help     # Show help
```

### Prerequisites
1. PostgreSQL running on localhost:5432
2. Database initialized: `./devops/cli.sh init-pg`
3. Environment variables set (or use defaults)
4. Powerwash enabled: `export CASKFS_ENABLE_POWERWASH=true`

### Environment Variables
```bash
export CASKFS_ROOT_DIR=./cache
export CASKFS_ENABLE_POWERWASH=true
export CASKFS_PG_HOST=localhost
export CASKFS_PG_PORT=5432
export CASKFS_PG_DATABASE=caskfs_db
export CASKFS_ACL_ENABLED=true
export CASKFS_ACL_DEFAULT_REQUESTOR=test-user
```

## Test Statistics

- **Total Test Files**: 3 main test suites + 1 helpers
- **Total Lines of Test Code**: ~1,665 lines
- **Test Categories**: 15+ major categories
- **Individual Tests**: 50+ test cases
- **Helper Functions**: 15+ utility functions

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Coverage
- Tests cover all major CaskFS functionality
- Both positive and negative test cases
- Real-world workflow scenarios
- Edge cases and error conditions

### Test Isolation
- Each test is independent
- Proper setup/teardown in hooks
- Database state management
- File cleanup between tests

### Developer-Friendly
- Clear test descriptions
- Helpful error messages
- Easy-to-run scripts
- Comprehensive documentation

### CI/CD Ready
- GitHub Actions workflow included
- Automated testing on push/PR
- Multiple Node.js version testing
- Database service integration

## Next Steps

### To Run Tests
1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running: `./devops/start-dev.sh`
2. Initialize database: `./devops/cli.sh init-pg`
3. Run tests: `npm test` or `./test/run-tests.sh all`

### To Add New Tests
1. Add test cases to appropriate test file
2. Use helpers from `test/helpers.js`
3. Follow existing test patterns
4. Update documentation if needed

### To Debug Tests
1. Run specific test file: `node --test test/caskfs.test.js`
2. Use verbose mode: `npm run test:verbose`
3. Run single test: `node --test --test-name-pattern="test name"`
4. Check test logs and error messages

## Notes

- Tests use Node.js built-in test runner (no external dependencies)
- Powerwash must be enabled for clean state between test runs
- Some RDF tests may be skipped if RDF layer has limitations
- Tests assume local PostgreSQL and file system storage (not GCS)

## Benefits

✅ **Confidence** - Comprehensive test coverage ensures code quality
✅ **Documentation** - Tests serve as usage examples
✅ **Regression Prevention** - Catch breaking changes early
✅ **Refactoring Safety** - Tests ensure functionality remains intact
✅ **CI/CD Integration** - Automated testing on every commit
✅ **Developer Onboarding** - New developers can see how to use the library
